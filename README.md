Description:-

This project is about migrating a simple student database from MySQL to PostgreSQL using a CSV file as the bridge. The main purpose was to practice how to shift data between two different relational databases manually, while understanding file-based data movement and structure compatibility. First, I created a table and inserted sample student records in MySQL. Then I exported the data as a .csv file using the built-in export feature of MySQL Workbench.

After preparing the CSV file, I created the same table manually in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin. Then i imported the CSV using the pgAdmin graphical import tool. Once imported, I checked the data visually and through simple queries to ensure everything was transferred properly. The table structure, values, and data types were consistent on both sides.

This project helped me gain experience with using CSV files to transfer data, and also made me comfortable using MySQL Workbench and pgAdmin interfaces for basic database tasks. It also taught me how to troubleshoot common errors that occur during file-based imports. All the necessary SQL files, CSV, and documentation are included in this repository.
